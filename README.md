# dotfiles

My version controlled dotfiles.

## Note on approach

It is preferable to keep this repo simple, with portable dotfiles that can
easily be cloned and used to configure essential tooling on any machine, than to
have this be heavily automated but temperamental.

As such, this repo will ideally contain only files that are:

1. Manually written (i.e.: not the consequence of installing some plugin).
2. Fairly universal.

These files should be symlinked to where they are needed to take effect. In most
cases it is not necessary to symlink the entire contents of `.config` or even
sub-directories of it and I will prefer to only link the subsets of that
directory that I have interacted with most manually.

It may sometimes be more appropriate to make notes here on how to configure
something, than to try and store the config itself. For example, VSCode
extensions and settings.json are more easily managed by syncing than by using
this repo.

## TODOs

- Add descriptions to remaps / register with which-key.
- Bring final vimscript functions across to Lua.
- Add i3 setup instructions for Linux.
- Try and get gui MacOS settings defined in config files.
